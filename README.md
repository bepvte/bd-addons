# Bep's BetterDiscord Plugins

My plugins for [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp)

* [**GifSaver**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/gifsaver.plugin.js): Automatically backs up your favorited gifs in your plugins folder, and then restores them if discord erases them
* [**CanaryLinks**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/CanaryLinks.plugin.js): When clicking "Copy Message Link" on Discord Canary or PTB, make links start with `https://discord.com/channels/` instead of `https://canary.discord.com/channels/`
* [**NoSpotifyPause**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/NoSpotifyPause.plugin.js): Prevents Discord from pausing your Spotify when streaming or gaming
* [**StereoSound**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/StereoSound.plugin.js): Adds stereo sound to your own microphone's output. Requires a capable stereo microphone. *Currently has an annoying bug, where discords audio processing is applied to the left channel but not the right.*
  
  **I kindly request that you dont use this in random voice calls**, but instead only for DJing, playing instruments, singing, Dungeons and Dragons, or maybe with a small friend group of people who don't mind.
  It sounds very annoying to me and many others when people use it for their voice, and its even more annoying to me that people use this plugin to be more noticable or louder in voice calls then other people. Don't ruin this plugin for everyone else!
