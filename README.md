# Bep's BetterDiscord Plugins

My plugins for [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app)

* [**GifSaver**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/gifsaver.plugin.js): GifSaver is sunset, as the feature is built into discord now. Currently, the plugin exports your most recent gif backup to a file for you, since the new discord gif store is limited to 250 gifs.
* [**CanaryLinks**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/CanaryLinks.plugin.js): When clicking "Copy Message Link" on Discord Canary or PTB, make links start with `https://discord.com/channels/` instead of `https://canary.discord.com/channels/`
* [**NoSpotifyPause**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/NoSpotifyPause.plugin.js): Prevents Discord from pausing your Spotify when streaming or gaming
* [**StereoSound**](https://youtu.be/FoMYgc4wXx4): Used to provide stereo audio input, is now broken. I also deleted it so people stop asking about it.
