# Bep's BetterDiscord Plugins

My plugins for [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp)

* [**GifSaver**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/gifsaver.plugin.js): Automatically backs up your favorited gifs in your plugins folder, and then restores them if discord erases them
* [**CanaryLinks**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepvte/bd-addons/main/plugins/CanaryLinks.plugin.js): When clicking "Copy Message Link" on Discord Canary, make links start with `https://discord.com/channels/` instead of `https://canary.discord.com/channels/`
