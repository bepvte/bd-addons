**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Environment**
<!-- please fill this out! -->
- Are you using Discord Canary or PTB?
- Are you using litecord or some other unsupported and weird client mod? If so, the issue will be closed and ignored.
- [ ] I have tested to verify that this does not occur when running without betterdiscord.
      (To test without betterdiscord, run the betterdiscord installer and press uninstall. Your plugins and settings wont be deleted)
- [ ] I have tested with no other plugins to confirm that the issue is with the specific plugin in question
